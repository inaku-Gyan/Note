# Linear Systems and Matrices

## Linear Systems

##### inconsistent
> ([[Linear Algebra with Applications.pdf#page=19&selection=205,0,205,12&color=note|Definition]])
>  If a linear system has no solution, we say that the system is inconsistent.

##### consistent
> ([[Linear Algebra with Applications.pdf#page=19&selection=209,0,209,10&color=note|Definition]])
> If the system has at least one solution, we say that it is consistent.

##### Strict Triangular Form

- if an $n × n$ system has exactly one solution, then an equivalent “strictly triangular system” can be obtained by using elementary row operations.

##### Overdetermined Systems
> ([[Linear Algebra with Applications.pdf#page=31&selection=32,0,32,14&color=note|Definition]])
> A linear system is said to be overdetermined if there are more equations than unknowns. 

##### Underdetermined Systems
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
A linear system is said to be underdetermined if there are more unknowns than equations.
```
##### Homogeneous Systems
```ad-abstract
title: Definition
A system of linear equations is said to be homogeneous if the constants on the righthand side are all zero.

```
###### Properties
- A homogeneous system is always consistent.
- An $m × n$ homogeneous system of linear equations has a nontrivial solution if $n > m$.
